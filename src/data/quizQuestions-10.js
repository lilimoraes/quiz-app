      question: "How does the nullish coalescing operator (??) differ from the || operator in JavaScript?",
      choices: [
        "The nullish coalescing operator only checks for null, while || checks for any falsy value.",
        "The nullish coalescing operator only checks for undefined, while || checks for any falsy value.",

        "The right operand",
        "An empty string",
        "A boolean value"
